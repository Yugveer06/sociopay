# Renter KYC Documentation

## Overview

The Renter KYC system allows administrators to upload and manage KYC (Know Your Customer) documents for society members. The system stores documents in Supabase storage and maintains metadata in the database.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Storage Setup

Before using the KYC upload functionality, you need to create a storage bucket in your Supabase project:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage > Buckets
3. Create a new bucket named `kyc-documents`
4. Set the bucket as **public** to allow document downloads
5. Configure appropriate access policies (see Security section below)

### 2. Database Schema

The system uses a `kyc_documents` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE kyc_documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  download_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  uploaded_by TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
  file_size TEXT,
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'application/pdf'
);
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

## Features

### Upload Functionality

- **File Type**: Only PDF files are allowed
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB per file
- **Drag & Drop**: Support for drag and drop file upload
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress indication
- **User Selection**: Choose which renter the document belongs to

### Document Management

- **View Documents**: View uploaded PDF documents in browser
- **Download**: Download documents to local device
- **Search**: Search by document name or renter name
- **Filter**: Filter documents by various criteria
- **Sorting**: Sort documents by upload date, size, etc.
- **Delete Protection**: Only administrators can delete KYC documents to ensure document integrity and compliance ðŸ”’

### Admin-Only Features

- **Delete Documents**: Only users with admin role can delete KYC documents
- **Document Immutability**: Regular users cannot delete documents once uploaded, ensuring audit trail compliance

### Statistics Dashboard

- **Total Documents**: Count of all uploaded documents
- **Users with KYC**: Number of users who have KYC documents
- **Today's Uploads**: Documents uploaded today

## Security Considerations

### Permission System

The KYC system implements strict permission controls:

- **Admin Users**: Have `delete-all` permissions to delete any KYC document
- **Regular Users**: Can only `upload-own`, `list-own`, `view-own`, and `download-own` documents
- **Document Immutability**: Once uploaded, regular users cannot delete documents, ensuring compliance and audit trail integrity

### Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
// Admin permissions (full access)
admin.renterKyc: ['upload-all', 'list-all', 'view-all', 'download-all', 'delete-all']

// User permissions (restricted - no delete!)
user.renterKyc: ['upload-own', 'list-own', 'view-own', 'download-own']
```

### Storage Bucket Policies

Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `kyc-documents` bucket:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to read documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read kyc documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND bucket_id = 'kyc-documents');

-- Allow service role to insert documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role to insert kyc documents" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role' AND bucket_id = 'kyc-documents');
```

### Database Policies

The `kyc_documents` table should have appropriate RLS policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE kyc_documents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow authenticated users to read all KYC documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read kyc documents" ON kyc_documents
FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to insert KYC documents
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert kyc documents" ON kyc_documents
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## Usage

### Accessing the KYC Page

1. Navigate to the "Renter KYC" page from the sidebar
2. The page displays statistics and a list of all uploaded documents

### Uploading a Document

1. Click the "Upload KYC Document" button
2. Select the renter from the dropdown
3. Either drag and drop a PDF file or click to browse and select
4. Click "Upload Document" to start the upload process
5. Monitor the progress bar during upload

### Managing Documents

- Use the search bar to find specific documents
- Click the actions menu (â‹®) on any document row to:
  - View the document in a new tab
  - Download the document
  - Copy the document ID
  - **Delete Document** (Admins only) - Only administrators can delete KYC documents to maintain document integrity

### Permission-Based Functionality

The interface automatically adapts based on user permissions:

- **Regular Users**: Can upload, view, download, and list their own documents
- **Administrators**: Have full access including the ability to delete any document
- **Delete Protection**: Regular users will not see delete options in the interface - documents are immutable once uploaded!
